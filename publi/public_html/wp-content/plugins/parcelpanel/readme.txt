### Why do you need an order tracking plugin for WooCommerce?
**More than 5% support tickets for order tracking**
If too many support tickets are about WISMO, then you're experiencing order tracking and shipment tracking issues. Additionally, a significant amount of repetitive work involved in manually tracking shipments will cause your costs to soar.

**Your customers are jumping through hoops**
Tracking orders and knowing estimated delivery dates should be effortless for customers. However, they often struggle with manually entering their order tracking numbers into a third-party tracking site and discover that there is no information available when the shipments haven't started shipping yet. This can lead to a poor order tracking experience and ultimately result in lost sales due to decreased customer excitement for their shipments.

**Consistent brand experience is being challenged**
Before a customer clicks to buy, you have complete control of the customer experience. However, once an order is placed and shipment tracking begins, the customer's experience is in the hands of a third-party carrier. Any issues with the order tracking process, such as a poorly designed tracking page or failure to load, can negatively impact your brand.
